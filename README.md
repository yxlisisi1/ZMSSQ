# ZMSSQ
This is the code for ZM-SSQ and Z-SSQ. You can open it to change the file paths and constants such as PARTITION_NUMBER, MAXBIT, LEN_SIZE, threshold, and other variables.You can also run different algorithms by uncommenting the code. 
Note that the value of MAXBIT is the maximum bit number that your computer can accept, minus LEN_SIZE, divided by PARTITION_NUMBER, and then rounded down.
The folder named 'ZcurveDataset1' contains all the datasets, while the folder named 'ZM-SSQ' contains the project files.
